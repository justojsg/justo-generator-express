## Working with React apps

If your *Express* app serves a *React* app, when the generator inquires
*React app?*, you can answer *Y* and then:

- The *Express* app must be developed as one project and the *React* app as other one.
- The *Express* app will be configured for serving a *React* app.
- Generally, the *React* app adds its code to the `public` folder.
